            Stem cells are prevalent throughout the body and vary in cell and layer. Among the three types, totipotent, pluripotent, and unipotent, pluripotent is the most common and shares some of the major commonalities of totipotent stem cells. Stem cells are unspecialized cells, proliferate and self-renew, and give rise to specialized cells. Aside from Embryonic stem cells, a major source of Stem cells are adult stem cells. These cells are undifferentiated and give rise to therapies for a variety of diseases. Adult stem cells in bone marrow will give rise to regenerative medicine completely revolutionizing medicine in the coming years.

            Hematopoietic stem cells(HSC) are approved by the FDA for the treatment of blood cancers. Throughout the globe there has been a growing acceptance of stem cells throughout South America, Latin America, Asia, and North America. In cooperation with sports leagues, other stem cell therapies are quickly picking up steam, among them is mesenchymal stem cells(MSC). Like HSCs, MSCs arise from adult stem cells found in bone marrow. Present in fetal tissue, MSCs play a role in tissue repair. This simple fact opens the door to a symbiotic relationship with athletes throughout the nation. Mesenchymal stem cells play an integral role in expediting the time for NFL athletes (for example) to get back on the field. An aid to repairing fractures, tears, breaks, and sprains that slow athletes down. These cells are not only in bone marrow either, MSCs are found in adipose tissue, cord blood and wharton's jelly, endometrium, peripheral blood, and the salivary glands. This information is valuable because the entry points for MSCs are far reaching and can address a multiplicity of injuries and diseases. For example, MSCs being sourced from peripheral blood could aid in stem cell treatment for a football player whom tore his bicep. The breadth of anatomical fields opens for a door mesenchymal stem cells to treat an abundance of diseases and injuries.

        <h2>Proof of Work </h2>
        <p>
            Proof of work is not a novel concept and was developed to prevent server abuse. In the form of Bitcoin, it is used as a consensus algorithm. This consensus algorithm is integral for Bitcoin to remain neutral and have no single point of failure. In order for Bitcoin to be produced, it is dependent on miners. These miners produce the cryptocurrency and are rewarded with a block reward for mining the block. In a proof-of-work system, the miner must solve a complicated problem in order to mine the block. As opposed to proof-of-stake, in which miners receive a block reward in the form of transaction fees. There are some problems associated with that, a project will now have a single point of failure and the block is based on a stake, not on merit. Bitcoin, however, relies on computational power and incentivizes miners to solve the problem to get the reward. Another problem with proof-of-stake is that the projects are based on stake, so poorer nations might not be able to participate due to high transaction fees. Proof-of-work coins rely on computational power rather than a stake. The problem associated with proof-of-work is a 51 attack, in which if a computer has more computational power than the other nodes it can take over the network. With computational power, as more people get onto the network, the more difficult it becomes to execute a 51-49 attack.

        <h2>Bitcoin as Money</h2>
        <p>
            What is money? A medium of exchange for value between two parties. The currency must be durable. It must be portable; thus why gold is not good money. It must be fungible, with no difference among others of the same currency. It must have verifiability and authenticity. It must be divisible and have a level of scarcity.
        </p>

            Why do people broach alternative money to the US Dollar and worry about its value? This convoluted question begins with the short history of money in the last hundred-fifty years. Although gold is not portable, its value has remained relatively the same the last hundred, thus making it an asset you can stake value in. Since 1880, the United States has had two gold-standard periods in its history. "The first was from 1880-1914, known as the classical gold standard". "Congress passed the "Gold Standard Act" fixing its price at $20.67 an ounce". The second, being the "Bretton Woods system in which most countries settled international balances in US dollars". This period lasted until "1971 when President Richard Nixon announced the US would no longer redeem currency for gold." This is not a diatribe of the decision of President Nixon, it, however, is a pivotal move for the global economy fifty years later. With the US and the rest of the global economy without a "safety net" how has the global economy faired in terms of inflation and bankruptcy. A decade later, "Mexico becomes the first of many Latin American nations to have a debt crisis". "Twelve years later, Mexican peso devalued, prompting IMF $50 billion-program to stabilize Mexican economy. Followed by Russia and Brazil seeking financial assistance". "15 years later, another financial crisis, this time in Asia. Thailand, Indonesia, and South Korea seeking billions of dollars in financial assistance from the IMF." Fast-forward to the infamous 2008 crisis, where the US now required a bailout. Followed by another continent facing a financial collapse. "Several European nations including Cyprus, Greece, Ireland, and Portugal, required IMF bailout between 2010 and 2013".

            Fifty years, four continents, four massive financial collapses. All subject to bailout from the IMF and consumer purchasing power is rapidly decreasing in the last two years. There was one benefit that came from the 2008 collapse, the birth of Bitcoin. What is Bitcoin? According to the whitepaper, “Bitcoin is a  purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash that would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution”. Let us review what money is about Bitcoin. Money has to be durable and portable. Bitcoin is digital money and is stored on an immutable ledger called a Blockchain which is stored in a digital cloud. Bitcoin is held on a digital wallet, either a wallet(mobile app) on a phone or a hardware wallet that works like a USB. Money must be fungible, meaning there is no difference between that of the currency. One Bitcoin is the same as that of another, it is fungible. Money has verifiability, as stated earlier, Bitcoin is stored on a public digital ledger called a blockchain where every transaction is validated. Money must be divisible, Bitcoin is divisible in terms of Satoshi where you can break down one Bitcoin. As of December 14, 2021, the price of Bitcoin is $47,962.50. This price must be broken down into a smaller value, a satoshi is a millionth of one Bitcoin. One major difference between many fiat currencies and Bitcoin is that of its scarcity. Fiat currencies are not only controlled by central entities, these entities can manipulate the value of the currency by printing. According to "The Bitcoin Standard", "Bitcoin has unforgeable costliness, it is difficult to mine due to its electric cost, thus making it scarce". Not only that, "Bitcoin has a set supply of 21 million and practices halving, or the use of cutting the block reward in half to reduce the supply by de-incentivizing mining more Bitcoin". These processes are to reduce the inflation of the coin and make it more scarce.
Why not go back to a gold standard? The obvious answer, the lack of portability and divisibility make gold a terrible use as money. When you unpack the history of money for the last 150 years, one theme you find is centralization. Rather the IMF, Bretton Woods, or Congress, relying solely on a central entity for the global economy has only caused financial collapse across multiple continents and higher and higher levels of inflation. Re-instituting gold as the standard is a slippery slope for one nation to control its supply and force the global economy to succumb to that nation. Thus creating a cyclical system of the financial collapse that we witness today. Let us do deep dive into the Stock-to-flow ratios of the two assets.
What is Stock-to-Flow Ratio? Stock-to-Flow is an investment model that measures an asset's current stock against the rate of production or the total amount mined over the course of a year. A high Stock-to-Flow ratio results in low inflation and a low Stock-to-Flow ratio results in high inflation. The estimated S2F ratio of Bitcoin is 62 and the S2F of Gold is 57. Not to mention, the halving process will result in an increased S2F ratio of Bitcoin. Although the S2F ratio does not determine the price of an asset, a low S2F ratio has resulted in the collapse of the currency. The Stock-to-Flow ratio goes a long way in determining the success of a currency and its value as money.
